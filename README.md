# README
 The purpose of Phraseology is to gather students young and old who want to learn Mandarin. Through continual practice by attending events and studying the videos online, one can hope to become fluent in Chinese.

As a user, one should be able to create lessons through linking useful YouTube videos to help other users learn Chinese.

As a user, one should be able to create social events that will help users practice their Chinese in real life and to work on their tones.

As a user, one should be able to create a language level that will help differentiate levels of Chinese and foster growth with people in similar skill sets.

As the creator, I hope one is able to use Phraseology as an open source to help others practice and improve their Chinese.
